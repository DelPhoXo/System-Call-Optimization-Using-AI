# System Call Prediction using LSTM

## Overview
This project aims to optimize system performance by predicting upcoming system calls using an LSTM-based deep learning model. By preloading and caching frequently used system calls, the model reduces execution time and enhances efficiency. The project consists of three core modules: **Data Preprocessing**, **Model Training**, and **Prediction Engine**.

## Features
- **System Call Sequence Processing:** Cleans and tokenizes system call sequences.
- **LSTM-Based Prediction:** Trains a deep learning model to forecast system calls.
- **Caching and Batch Execution:** Improves efficiency by preloading and grouping system calls.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Provides a visual representation of system call predictions.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Flask (for the dashboard)

### Steps to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/System-Call-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd System-Call-Prediction
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Train the model:
   ```sh
   python Model_Training/train_model.py
   ```
5. Run the prediction engine and dashboard:
   ```sh
   python Prediction_Engine/dashboard.py
   ```
6. Open `dashboard.html` in your browser to view the predictions.

## Future Enhancements
